# My Personal Portfolio Site

This project is my final project submission for the Code Louisville Front End Web Development cohort. The project can be viewed [here](https://matthewfante.github.io/Personal-Portfolio/) or the project files can be downloaded and viewed by opening the index.html file in your web browser. 

Although the consultation form provides feedback in the form of a confirmation page, this project is Front End only -- no data submitted in the form is saved or submitted in any way.

This project is hosted on GitHub Pages at https://matthewfante.github.io/Personal-Portfolio/
